# Style-Transfer-project
This project demonstrates image style transfer using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), based on the method described by Gatys et al. in their research paper "Image Style Transfer Using Convolutional Neural Networks". The technique leverages the features extracted from the VGG19 model to blend the content of one image with the style of another.
